## Suspicious Patterns

### Install-Time Scripts

Red flags in package.json:
- `postinstall`: Code runs after `npm install`
- `preinstall`: Pre-installation hooks
- `prepare`: Development dependency hook
- `prepublish`: Publishing hook

### Network Indicators

Suspicious patterns:
- Hardcoded IP addresses (especially non-local)
- Base64-encoded domains
- DNS lookups for reconnaissance
- Data sent to external servers
- Command and control patterns

### File System Red Flags

Dangerous operations:
- Writing to `~/.npmrc`, `~/.ssh/`, `~/.aws/`
- Modifying `/etc/hosts`
- Creating cron jobs
- Writing to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`
- Modifying systemd services

## Quick Checks

1. **Age**: Package published < 30 days with high download count = suspicious
2. **Maintainer**: Single maintainer with no history = suspicious
3. **Dependencies**: Heavy dependency tree = attack surface
4. **Repository**: No GitHub link or dead link = suspicious
5. **License**: No license or proprietary = investigate further
